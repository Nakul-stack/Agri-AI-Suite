STATIC FILES FIXED - RESTART SERVER
============================================================

I've fixed the CSS and JavaScript file serving issue.

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Go to the terminal where the server is running
2. Press Ctrl+C to stop it
3. Run again: python server.py
   OR double-click: START_AI.bat

After restarting, refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or F5)

The form should now work and show results when you submit!
